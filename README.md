# HANDWRITTEN_DIGIT_RECOGNIZER_PROJECT
This project is a handwritten digit recognition system that utilizes machine learning techniques to identify and classify handwritten digits. The goal of this project is to build a model capable of recognizing and correctly classifying handwritten digits, typically in the range of 0 to 9, with high accuracy.
